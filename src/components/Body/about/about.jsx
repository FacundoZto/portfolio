            started in the programming world through Henry Bootcamp, which
            allowed me to develop as a Full Stack Web Developer. Currently, I
            focus on Front End development, working on projects to reinforce
            acquired concepts and learn new technologies.
            <br /> Motivated to work in teams and seeking new challenges where I
            can contribute value and grow professionally.
